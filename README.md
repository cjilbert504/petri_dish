# PetriDish
⚠️ The current experimentation work is being done over on https://github.com/cjilbert504/petri_dish_experiment - The idea is to have the repository linked used as a playground before extracting the functionality out and into this repository. So currently this repository is just a placeholder so that I could grab the name on Ruby Gems :)
