# PetriDish
⚠️ The current experimentation work is being done over on https://github.com/cjilbert504/petri_dish_experiment - The idea is to have the repository linked used as a playground before extracting the functionality out and into this repository. So currently this repository is just a placeholder so that I could grab the name on Ruby Gems :)

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "petri_dish"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install petri_dish
```
